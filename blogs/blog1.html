    <h1>Why you shouldn’t invest much on your college??!!</h1>
    <h4>Hi I am Manju Prasad, Currently working as Graduate intern at RSA. Presenting you my blog on “why you shouldn’t invest much on college education” . All the views and opinions written in this blog are my personal views and experiences.</h4>
    <h4>With the cost of college tution fee increasing every year and the job prospects looking questionable many wonder whether to invest much on college education or to go for a college with reasonable tution fee. In my opinion the investment on college education should not only be based on infrastructure, Ranking, Facilities, Placements and Return on Investment terms. But also should be on personal preferences and benefits.</h4>
    <h4>Aiming at the mediocre students who couldn’t get into top 10 or top 50 colleges in the country I would suggest them to get into some cheap colleges with good learning environment and stay self motivated and work towards the improvements of skills. Cheaper colleges in the sense many state run government engineering colleges also do offer the same education at a very reasonable price. For example the total cost of one year at a government college in Karnataka is 20K where as the conventional private college requires more than four times of the same. In other terms the education in india is non profitable and in the mean while why to waste money on some private institutions whose sole purpose is profit making. I would also suggest students not to waste their parents savings on finding a fancy luxury college.</h4>
    <h4>Secondly nearly about half of the graduates don’t work in the same domain that they graduated in. we will not be sure about what our lives would be after four years of engineering. Moreover aims and dreams do change a lot during this time. Because the age between 18-24 is the time where we realize ourselves and make a clear picture of our future goals. Instead in the same four years of time the student can realize his future goals and work towards the same.</h4>
    <h4>The four years of engineering is the time where we should not only focus on earning a degree but also we should focus on improving our skills. The skills that we learn during this time should be helpful in both our professional and personal life too.</h4>
    <h4>In the mean while in the pursuit of finding a cheaper college one should not forget to choose a wise location. I would suggest students to go for colleges in big cities like Bangalore, Hyderabad, Chennai or Delhi. Because big cities are the place where we find ample amount of opportunities for career. The vicinity to big tech cities like bangalore is always a boon for engineering grads.</h4>
    <h4>Making my final words on this , after a few years of completion of college education when we look back and see it is the experience and knowledge that that matters and not the degree or the ranking of the college that we have.</h4>
